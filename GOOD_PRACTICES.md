# Good Practices
  - ListView - consider ScrollBar and RefreshIndicator widgets too
  - Code Review
    - Include assert statements for ensuring all the variables are ready to be used in a function
    - Explicit object types - declare objects with explicit data types. If things go with dynamic type we can't control which road they go.
